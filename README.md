The design process firstly consisted of creating individual parts: Designing each component of the G-clamp separately, such as the frame, jaw, spindle, and handle.
Subsequently assembling the parts and use the assembly features in AutoCAD to combine the individual parts, creating a functional model where the parts interact correctly.
Lastly, depending on the purpose, additional details like threads for the screw or a swivel pad for the jaw are added.
